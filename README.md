# Natural Language Processing
This repo contains the assignments, labs, and project work completed during the Natural Language Processing course taken at Reykjav√≠k University during the Fall Semester 2024. The objective of this repository is to explore and implement various NLP techniques such as sequence tagging, syntactic and semantic analysis, discourse and dialogue processing, and more.

## Repository Structure
The repository is structured as follows:
- [Book](book/): Contains the code developed following the book Natural Language Processing with Python;

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.x (already included in Google Colab);
- No additional setup is required as all necessary libraries will be installed within the notebooks themselves.

## Setup
1A. Clone the repository to your local machine (optional if you want to work offline);
  ```
  git clone git@github.com:giorgiosld/Natural-Language-Processing.git
  ```

1B. Alternatively, you can open the notebooks directly in Google Colab by clicking the Colab badge:
  ```
  [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/giorgiosld/Natural-Language-Processing/blob/main/book_exercises/NLP_exercise.ipynb)
  ```

2: Once the notebook is open in Colab, you can execute the cells and modify the code as needed.
